                    The blogs will not cover all the days we met up, it will cover the days where major events, progress, or days we thought were worthwhile to document.

                    <br><br>

                    <span class="card-title">Means of Communication</span>
                    <p>We decided to mainly use Facebook Messenger as a way of communication between the two of us. Since Marin has a server, we will use that as a medium for all our work, since gitlab is limited in some regards. When big changes happen we will push to git.</p>

                    <p>
                    Major decisions will be decided by the two of us, if we couldnt reach a conclusion on a topic, we will use Steve Blotts opinion on the matter to decide how we will continue. 
                    </p>

                    <span class="card-title">Meeting Each Other</span>
                    <p>
                      When it comes to work like major design work, how we treat data and major changes to the application, we usually meet up in person and to work together, to finish all major changes.

                              <p>Met up with each other to discuess the idea of our project, 
                                which came as a general conclusion of a messaging application,
                                 that essentially combines different social media messaging platforms together
                                 into one application</p>
                              <p>
                                Our aim is to incorparate facebook,whatsupp and instagram as the foundation to the application.
                                Over time develop the application even more.
                              </p>

                                Getting ready for the presentation, we need to create a prototype of the interface
                                of our application and create the appropriate slides.

                                          When it comes to the frontend, both indivisual will help develop the interface.

                                         First time working with the facebook api, the first problem was having the passwords visible on the termnal
                                         ,solving it by making them variable, instead of hrdcoding the password.
                                          The next problem facebook api were sending mixed up data,
                                          once figuired it out there were problems with the pull_history by modifiying the facebook api library, the problem was solved.
                                          library logs were also in the way, therefore took them out. 
                                          Documentation was pretty poor, therefore had to trail and error some of the funtions given by the library to get the event lisnter working.
                                          Formatting was also a big problem.
                                          fixing pull history had to rewrite the response by parsing it.

                                             users having to register with our application first and then signing in.
                                             After discuessing it with each other we wanted to add the feature of signing in with facebook or google,
                                             like modern applications do.
                                             After finishing the design and getting the user to register and log in, we decided to remove the registration feature,
                                             because we didnt want to deal with user accounts, for efficency we let third party handle users accounts.

                                            its made with simplicity and fluidty in design.
                                            Using the prototype we had as a foundation to start, our design would initially be like
                                            "Whatsupp" or Facebook Messenger.
                                            Simplicity would be the aim of the design, simple chat lobby with various features, and a working chat messaging.

                             While doing the design, we decided to start on the client/server,
                             client does what the server asks it to do and it can make requests to the server.
                             Testing it out by sending messages from the client to server and vice vera.
                             The biggest obstacle was sending object requests, which was solved by making strings out
                             of those objects.

                      Materialize documentation isnt documented very well, will have to create our own css from some parts,
                      using the javascript provided by the documentation to enable certain features.
                      Discussion was made on where and how the buttons for the "Break,Combine and Delete" was going to be 
                      placed and how they would interact with the system. 
                      Discuessed how it would change the chat interface, when clicking on "break" or "combine" it would combine
                      the users social media account into one. We thought of this example to explain the funtionality of the buttons.<br>
                      Example:
                      Hasan logs into Cubik and goes on to services where he logs into facebook,
                      there he picks his conversation with Marin, which is then imported to cubik chat lobby.
                      Hasan then logs into Skype and picks a conversation with Marin he had on skype, where its also imported
                      to cubiks application.
                      Hasan then clicks on the "combine" button, where the two seperate chats combine, where after its ceated, Hasan
                      clicks on the "break" button, which seperates the chat into their original state.

                           Finished designing the application, still changable until the due date. Working on getting
                           skype api to work, still need to fully integrate facebook api.
                           As for the third API we still havnt found a suitable one.  

                           Even with two api, they are vastly different and finding the bit in the middle is really hard.
                           Each API returns entirely different formatting so there needs to be another common format between the two.
